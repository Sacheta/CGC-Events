- and "cgcevents" is a perfect fit for this description of tech. <br><br>
It is a hosted website dedicated to cumber down the tiring and time-consuming efforts of making announcements, physically making announcements, multiple times a day. CGC witness many events all throughout the year. And to keep up the drill, this happening culture, volunteers take the front posts. Being been volunteer ourselves, we know how crucial announcements are for the success of events. But aren't they time- consuming, and a constant headache too!
 
<br><br>To help the college, and us, we developed/ developing a website, dedicated website for events. It will have all the details about upcoming, present and recent events. Not just that, dedicated forms for participation, coordination and volunteering too. The filled-in forms will auto-update our database providing us with all the required information to proceed. 
<br>
We have created webpages with HTML and CSS. Used MySQL for database, PHP for linking and MyPHPadmin as our server.
<br><br>
This project is of so much potential. It won't just help volunteers, organisers but teachers too, as there won't be students knocking at their classroom doors right in the middle of an important topic.
<br>
We are looking forward to furthering progress.<br><br><br><br>
